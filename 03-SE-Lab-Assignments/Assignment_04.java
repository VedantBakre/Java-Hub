/*
Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to demonstrate the concept of Runtime Polymorphism
using method overriding.

Create a superclass Employee with data members name and salary and a method
calculateSalary(). Then create two subclasses:
1. PermanentEmployee – calculates salary as Basic Salary + Bonus.
2. ContractEmployee – calculates salary as Hours Worked × Hourly Rate.

Use method overriding so that calculateSalary() behaves differently for
each subclass. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by creating superclass
references to subclass objects.

    String name;

    // Constructor
    Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;

    }

    // Method to calculate salary
    void calculateSalary() {
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
    }

// Subclass - Permanent Employee

    double bonus;

    PermanentEmployee(String name, double salary, double bonus) {
